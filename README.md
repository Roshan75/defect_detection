# Defect detection and classification with ZSL and FSL
##This Repository contains
-	Zero shot learning image classification training and testing details
-	Few shot learning image classification training and testing details
-	And general detection code for zero shot learning and few shot learning.

##Zero Shot Learning:
Here I have used MvTec Ads Carpet defected images. And check “zsl_reports” document for detailed information

##Few Shot Learning:
Here I have used MvTec Ads Transistor defected images. And check “fsl_reports” document for detailed information

##The General Detection 
General detection code will give the results for, find the defect in carpet images with zsl model and find the defect in transistor with fsl model.

##To detect the carpet defects use command-
“python detection.py –input_image image_path –model zsl”

##To detect the transistor defects use command-
“python detection.py –input_image image_path –model fsl”
